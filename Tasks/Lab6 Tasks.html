<h1> lab 6 </h1>
In this lab, you should perform <b> task 0, task 1a and task 1b before attending the lab session</b>.
This lab may be done in pairs (as a rule, members of a pair must be in the same lab group, and should inform the TA(s)).
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li> Get acquainted with command interpreters ("shell") by implementing a simple command interpreter.
</li><li> Understand how Unix/Linux fork() and exec() work.
</li><li> Intruduction to Linux signals.
</li><li> Learn how to read the manual (man).
</li></ul>
<br>
<div class="info"><b>Note</b><br>
Labs 6 is independent of Lab 5.<br>
You are indeed expected to link your code with stdlib, and use the C 
standard library wrapper functions which invoke the system calls.
<p></p><p>
<br>
Nevertheless, you will be extending your code from lab 6 - task1 in lab 7, so try make your code readable and modular.
</p></div>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p> Perhaps the most important system program is the <b>command
interpreter</b>, that is, the program that gets user commands and
executes them. The command interpreter is thus the major interface
between the user and the operating system services. There are two main
types of command interpreters: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Command-line interpreters, which receive user commands in text form and execute them (also called <b>shell</b> in UNIX-like systems). </li>
  <li> Menu-based interpreters, where the user selects commands from a 
menu. At the most basic level, menus are text driven. At the most 
extreme end, everything is wrapped in a nifty graphical display (e.g. 
Windows or KDE command interpreters). </li>
<p></p><p>
</p></ul>
<h3 id="lab_goals">Lab Goals</h3>
In this sequence of labs, you will be implementing a simple shell 
(command-line interpreter). Like traditional UNIX shells, your shell 
program will <b>also</b> be a <b>user level</b> process (just like all 
your programs to-date), that will rely heavily on the operating system's
 services. Your shell should do the following:
<ul>
  <li> Receive commands from the user. </li>
  <li> Interpret the commands, and use the operating system to help starting up programs and processes requested by the user. </li>
  <li> Manage process execution (e.g. run processes in the background, suspend them, etc.), using the operating system's services. </li>
</ul>
<p> The complicated tasks of actually starting up the processes, mapping
their memory, files, etc. are strictly a responsibility of the
operating system, and as such you will study these issues in the
Operating Systems course. Your responsibility, therefore, is limited to telling the operating system which
processes to run, how to run these processes (run in the background/foreground) etc.</p>
<p> Starting and maintaining a process involves many technicalities, and
 like any other command interpreter we will get assistance from system 
calls, such as <font color="green"> execv, fork, waitpid </font> (see <b>man</b> on how to use these system calls).<br>
</p>
<h2 id="lab_5_tasks">lab 6 tasks</h2>
First, download <a href="https://moodle.bgu.ac.il/moodle/pluginfile.php/3724005/mod_resource/content/1/LineParser.c">LineParser.c</a> and <a href="https://moodle.bgu.ac.il/moodle/pluginfile.php/3724006/mod_resource/content/2/LineParser.h">LineParser.h</a>.
These files contain some useful parsing and string management functions that will simplify your 
code substantially. Make sure you appropriately refer to LineParser.c in your makefile. You can find a detailed explanation 
<a href="https://moodle.bgu.ac.il/moodle/mod/resource/view.php?id=2316251">here</a>.
<div class="warning">
Through out the lab pay close attention to the difference between <b>processes</b>(things that you run with execvp() after fork()) and <b>command lines</b>.
 Think when do you need a new process and when to use the process of the
 shell. Running things in a different process preserves inter-activeness
 with the shell. However, not all things can be run in a new process.
</div>
<h3 id="task_0a"><font size="+1"> Task 0a </font></h3>
Here you are required to write a basic shell program <b>myshell</b>. 
Keep in mind that you are expected to extend this basic shell during the next tasks.
In your code write an infinite loop and carry out the following:
<p></p><p>
</p><ol>
  <li> Display a prompt - the current working directory (see man getcwd). The path name is not expected to exceed <b>PATH_MAX</b> (it's defined in <b>linux/limits.h</b>, so you'll need to include it).
</li>
  <li> Read a line from the "user", i.e. from stdin (no more than 2048 bytes). It is advisable to use <b>fgets</b> (see man).
</li>
  <li> Parse the input using <b>parseCmdLines()</b> (LineParser.h).
The result is a structure <b>cmdLine</b> that contains all necessary parsed data.
</li>
  <li> Write a function <b>execute(cmdLine *pCmdLine)</b> that receives a parsed line and invokes
the program specified in the cmdLine using the proper system call (see man <b>execv</b>).
</li>
  <li> Use <b>perror</b> (see man) to display an error if the execv fails, and then exit "abnormally".
</li>
<li> Release the cmdLine resources when finished.
</li>
  <li> End the infinite loop of the shell if the command "quit" is entered in the shell, and exit the shell "normally".
</li>
</ol>
<br>
Once you execute your program, you will notice a few things:
<ul>
  <li> Although you loop infinitely, the execution ends after execv. Why is that?
</li>
  <li> You must place the full path of an executable file in-order to run properly.
For instance: "ls" won't work, whereas "/bin/ls" runs properly. (Why?)
<br>
</li></ul>
<br>
<b>Now replace execv with execvp (see man) and try again </b>.
<ul>
<p></p><p>
</p><li> Wildcards, as in "ls *", are not working. (Again, why?)
</li>
</ul>
<br>
In addition to the reading material, please make sure you read up on and
 understand the system calls: fork(2), exec(2) and its variants, 
signal(2), and waitpid(2), before attending the "official" lab session.
<h3 id="task_0b"><font size="+1"> Task 0b </font></h3>
<p></p><p>
Add the signal handler <a href="https://moodle.bgu.ac.il/moodle/pluginfile.php/3724008/mod_resource/content/1/looper.c">looper.c</a>
 that prints the signal with a message saying it was received, and 
propagates the signal to the default signal handler. This is what really
 makes the process sleep/continue. The signals you need to address are: 
SIGTSTP, SIGINT, SIGCONT. The signals will be sent to the looper by the 
shell that you are going to write to test the functionality of the 
process manager that you are going to implement in task2. <br>
</p><ul>
<li> Use strsignal (see: <code class="code">man strsignal</code>) to get the signal name.
</li><li> See signal(2) you will need it to set your handler to handle these signals. 
</li><li> Use signal(signum, SIG_DFL) to make the default handler handle the signal.
</li><li> Use raise() to send the signal again, so that the default signal handler can handle it. 
<p></p><p>
</p></li><li> After handling SIGCONT, make sure you reinstate the custom handler for SIGTSTP
</li><li> After handling SIGTSTP, make sure you reinstate the custom handler for SIGCONT
</li></ul>
<br>
<hr><h3 id="task_1"><font size="+1"> Task 1 </font></h3>
In this task, you will make your shell work like a real command interpreter (tasks 1a and 1b), and then add various features.<br>
When executed with the "-d" flag, your shell will also print the debug 
output to stderr (if "-d" is not given, you should not print anything to
 stderr).
<h3 id="task_1a"><font size="+1"> Task 1a </font></h3>
Building up on your code from task 0, we would like our shell to remain active after invoking another program. 
The <b> fork </b> system call (see man) is the key: it 'duplicates' our process, 
creating an almost identical copy (<b>child</b>)
of the issuing (<b>parent</b>) process. 
For the parent process, the call returns the process ID of the newly-born child, whereas for
the child process - the value 0 is returned. 
<p></p><p>
</p><div class="info"><b>You will need to print to <code>stderr</code> the following debug information in your task:</b><br>
<p></p><p>
</p><ul>
<li> PID </li>
<li> Executing command </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p></p><p>
Notes:
</p><ul>
<li> Use fork to maintain the shell's activeness by forking before <b>execvp</b>, while handling the return code 
appropriately. (Although if fork( ) fails you are in real trouble!).
</li>
  <li> If execvp fails, use <b>_exit()</b> (see man) to terminate the process. (Why?)
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="task_1b"><font size="+1"> Task 1b </font></h3>

Until now we've executed commands without waiting for the process to terminate.
You will now use the <b>waitpid</b> call (see man), in order to implement the wait. 
Pay attention to the <b>blocking</b> field in cmdLine. 
It is set to 0 if a "&amp;" symbol is added at the end of the line, 1 otherwise.<br><br>
Invoke waitpid when you're required, and only when you're required. For 
example: "cat myshell.c &amp;" will not wait for the cat process to end 
(cat in this case runs in the <b>background</b>), but "cat myshell.c" will (cat runs in the <b>foreground</b>). 
<p></p><p>
</p><div class="info"><b>You will need to propagate the error messages of chdir to stderr.</b><br>
</div>
<h3 id="task_1c"><font size="+1"> Task 1c </font></h3>
Add a shell feature "cd" that allows the user to change the current working directory.
Essentially, you need to emulate the "cd" internal shell command. Use <b>chdir</b> for that purpose (see man). <b>Print appropriate error message to stderr if the cd operation fails.</b>
<p></p><p>
</p><div class="warning">
<b><span style="font-size:120%">Now that you finished task1, save it aside. You will need it for Lab 7.</span></b>
</div>
<h3 id="task_2_-_process_manager"><font size="+1"> Task 2 - Process Manager </font></h3>
Every program you run using the shell runs as a process. You can get a list of the running processes using the <code class="code">ps</code> program
(see: <code class="code">man 1 ps</code> and <code class="code">man 2 ps</code>).

In
 this task we are going to implement an internal shell "process manager"
 to manage the process we run in our shell (everything you fork). 
The process manager will provide 4 operations:
<ul>
<li> <code class="code">procs</code> - prints current processes including sleeping, running, and "freshly" terminated processes. 
</li><li> <code class="code">wake &lt;process id&gt; </code> - wakes up a sleeping process.
</li><li> <code class="code">suspend &lt;process id&gt;</code> - suspends a running process.
</li><li> <code class="code">kill &lt;process id&gt;</code> - terminates a running/sleeping process.
</li></ul>
<br>

<h3 id="task_2a_-_process_list">Task 2a - Process List</h3>
In this task will create and print a list of all processes that have been forked by your shell. <br>
<!--?}?-->

<h4>Representation</h4>
Create a linked list to store information about running/suspended processes. Each node in the list is a struct process:
<p></p><p>
</p><pre class="code">typedef struct process{
    cmdLine* cmd;                         /* the parsed command line*/
    pid_t pid; 		                  /* the process id that is running the command*/
    int status;                           /* status of the process: RUNNING/SUSPENDED/TERMINATED */
    struct process *next;	                  /* next process in chain */
} process;
</pre>

<p></p><p>
The field <i>status</i> can have one of the following values:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="code">#define TERMINATED  -1
#define RUNNING 1
#define SUSPENDED 0
</pre>

<h4>Implementation</h4>
Implement the following functions that create and print the process list:
<ul>
<li> <code class="code">void addProcess(process** process_list, cmdLine* cmd, pid_t pid);</code>: Receive a process list (process_list), a command (cmd), and the process id (pid) of the process running the command. 
</li><li> <code class="code">void printProcessList(process** process_list);</code>: print the processes. 
</li><li> Add support for the command <code class="code">procs</code> to the shell which prints processes using printProcessList()in the following format: <br>
<code class="code">&lt;index in process list&gt; &lt;process id&gt; &lt;process status&gt; &lt;the command together with its arguments&gt;</code>  
<p></p><p>
Example:<br>
</p><pre class="code">#&gt; sleep 3  # foreground, takes 3 seconds until we get prompt back
#&gt; procs
PID          Command      STATUS
14952        sleep        Terminated
#&gt; 
#&gt; sleep 5&amp; # background, we get prompt back immediately
#&gt; procs
PID          Command      STATUS
14962        sleep        Running
#&gt; # Wait for the process to finish
#&gt; 
#&gt; procs
PID          Command      STATUS
14962        sleep        Terminated
</pre>
<p></p>

<h3 id="task_2b_-_updating_the_process_list">Task 2b - Updating the Process List</h3>
Implement the following to add some functionality to your process list:
<ul>
<li> <code class="code">void freeProcessList(process* process_list);</code>: free all memory allocated for the process list.
</li><li> <code class="code">void updateProcessList(process **process_list);</code>:
  go over the process list, and for each process check if it is done, 
you can use waitpid with the option WNOHANG. WNOHANG does not block the 
calling process, the process returns from the call to waitpid 
immediately. If no process with the given process id exists, then 
waitpid returns -1.<br>
<b>In order to learn if a process was stopped (SIGTSTP), resumed 
(SIGCONT) or terminated (SIGINT), It's highly essential you read and 
understand how to use <u>waitpid(2)</u> before implementing this function</b>
</li><li> <code class="code">void updateProcessStatus(process* process_list, int pid, int status)</code>: find the process with the given id in the process_list and change its status to the received status.
</li><li> update <code class="code">void printProcessList(process** process_list);</code>: 
  <ul>
   <li> Run updateProcessList() at the beginning of the function.
   </li><li>If a process was "freshly" terminated, delete it after 
printing it (meaning print the list with the updated status, then delete
 the dead processes). 
  </li></ul>
</li></ul>
<h3 id="task_2c_-_manipulating_the_processes">Task 2c - Manipulating the Processes</h3>
In this task you will manipulate processes, using one of the following commands: 
<ul>
<li> <code class="code">suspend &lt;process id&gt;</code> - suspends a 
running process. Send SIGTSTP to the respective process. This is similar
 to typing CTRL-Z in the shell when running the process.
</li><li> <code class="code">kill &lt;process id&gt;</code> - terminates
 a running/sleeping process. Send SIGINT to the respective process. This
 is similar to typing CTRL-C in the shell when running a process.
</li><li> <code class="code">wake &lt;process id&gt; </code> - wakes up a sleeping process.  Send SIGCONT to the respective process. This is similar to typing <code class="code">fg</code> in a standard shell, right after typing CTRL-Z.
</li></ul>
<br>
Use kill(), see man 2 kill, to send the relevant signal to the given 
process id. Check if kill() succeeded and print an appropriate message.
Remember to update the status of the process in the process_list.<br>
<p></p><p>
Test your shell using your <code class="code">looper</code> code from task0b in the following scenario: 
</p><p>
</p><pre class="code">#&gt; ./looper&amp;
#&gt; ./looper&amp;
#&gt; ./looper&amp;
#&gt; procs
PID         Command     STATUS
18170       ./looper    Running
18171       ./looper    Running
18174       ./looper    Running
#&gt; kill 18170
#&gt; Looper handling SIGINT       # Message from the child process

#&gt; suspend 18174
#&gt; Looper handling SIGTSTP      # Message from the child process    
procs
PID         Command     STATUS
18170       ./looper    Terminated
18171       ./looper    Running
18174       ./looper    Suspended
#&gt; wake 18174
#&gt; Looper handling SIGCONT      # Message from the child process

#&gt; wake 18171   # What will happen to the process? (it is already running)
#&gt; Looper handling SIGCONT      # Message from the child process
procs
PID         Command     STATUS
18171       ./looper    Running
18174       ./looper    Running

</pre>
