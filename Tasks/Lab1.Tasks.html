<p> <b>Lab goals</b>: 
</p><ul>
<li> C primer
</li><li> Parsing command-line arguments
</li><li> Undestanding character encoding (ASCII)
</li><li> Implementing a debug mode for your program
</li><li> Introduction to standard streams (stdin, stdout, stderr)
</li><li> Simple stream IO library functions
</li></ul>

<p>
</p><h1>(This lab is to be done SOLO) </h1>


  <h2>Task 0: Maintaining a project using <tt>make</tt></h2>
<p>You should perform this task <b>before</b> attending the lab session.
  For this task, 3 files are provided: <a href="https://moodle.bgu.ac.il/moodle/pluginfile.php/3648975/mod_resource/content/1/add.s">add.s</a>, <a href="https://moodle.bgu.ac.il/moodle/pluginfile.php/3649133/mod_resource/content/1/main.c">main.c</a>, <a href="https://moodle.bgu.ac.il/moodle/pluginfile.php/3649134/mod_resource/content/1/numbers.c">numbers.c</a>.
  </p>The first file is assembly language code, and the other 2 are C source code.
<p></p>

<ol> 
  <li>Log in to Linux.</li>
  <li>Decide on an ASCII text editor of your choice (vi, emacs, kate, pico, nano, femto, or whatever). It is <b>your responsibility</b> to know how to operate
   the text editor well enough for all tasks in all labs.
  </li><li>
    Using the text editor that you decided to use, write a makefile for the given files (as explained in 
    the introduction to GNU Make Manual, see the
    [[lab1/reading|Reading Material]]).
    The Makefile should provide targets for compiling the program 
    and cleaning up the working directory. 
  </li>

  <li>
    Compile the project by executing make in the console.
  </li>

  <li>
    Read all of lab1 reading material before attending the lab, and make sure you <b>understand</b> it. This may entail writing simple code to exercise the use of library functions and
running it, in addition to any other task 0 code you are <b>required</b> to write.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    Read the puts(3) and printf(3) manuals. What is the difference between the functions?
    To read the manuals type man followed by the function name (e.g.  <code>man puts</code>) in a "console".
  </li>
</ol>
<h3> Important </h3>

To protect your files from being viewed or copied by other people, 
thereby possibly earning you a disciplinary hearing, employ the Linux 
permission system by running:
<code>
chmod 700 -R ~
</code>

In order to make sure you have sufficient space in your workspace,
run the following command once you're logged in

<code>
du -a | sort -n
</code>

Then you can see a list of your files/directories
and the amount of space each file/directory takes.

If you need space and KNOW which files to remove, you can do that by:
<code>
rm -f [filename]
</code>

<h3>Control+D, Control+C and Control+Z</h3>
<ul>
    <li>What does Control+D (^D) do?</li>
    <li>What does Control+C (^C) do?</li>
    <li>What does Control+Z (^Z) do?</li>
</ul>
Do not use Control+Z for terminating processes!!!
<h3>Writing a simple program</h3>
Write a simple echo program named my_echo: <br>
<dl>
  <dt> NAME </dt>
  <dd> my_echo - echoes text.</dd>
  <dt> SYNOPSIS </dt>
  <dd> my_echo </dd>
  <dt> DESCRIPTION </dt>
  <dd> my_echo prints out the text given in the command line by the user.
  </dd>  
  <dt> EXAMPLES </dt>
  <dd>
    <code>
#&gt; my_echo aa b c
    </code>
    
  </dd><dd>
    <code>
#&gt; aa b c
    </code>
</dd></dl>

<h4> Mandatory requirements</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Create a proper makefile as described in the reading material. </li>
  <li> Test your program to see that it actually works...
  </li>
</ul>


<warn title="The tasks below are to be done only during the lab session!">
Students coming with ready code "from home" will be assigned low priority <b>and</b> will have
to demonstrate re-writing all the code again <b>from scratch</b>.
Additionally, you are expected (of course) to understand your code completely.
</warn>


<h3> On this lab you can assume that the resulting encrypted char will always be in the range from 32 to 126 (inclusive). </h3>


<h2>Task 1: The encoder program</h2>

In this task we will write a program that encodes characters from the input text.
<br>As stated in task 0 and the reading material, you should already have consulted
   the man pages for <b>strncmp(3), fgetc(3), fputc(3), fopen(3), fclose(3)</b> before the lab.
      <br> 
Task 1 consists of three subtasks: 1a, 1b, 1c and 1d, each building on 
top of the previous subtask. Therefore, your program for each task 
should contain all the features from the previous tasks.<br><br>
      



  <!-- ---------------- T A S K   1 A -------------------- -->
<h3>Task 1a: A restricted encoder version - conversion to uppercase </h3>

The encoder program should be implemented as follows:<br>

<dl>
  <dt> NAME </dt>
  <dd> encoder - encodes the input text as uppercase letters.</dd>
  <dt> SYNOPSIS </dt>
  <dd> encoder </dd>
  <dt> DESCRIPTION </dt>
  <dd> 
      encoder reads the characters from standard input and prints the 
corresponding uppercase characters to the standard output. Non lowercase
 characters remain unchanged.
  </dd>
  <dt> EXAMPLES </dt>
  <dd>
    <code>
#&gt; encoder
<br>Hi, my name is Noah<br>
    </code>
  </dd>
 <dd>
     <code>
         #&gt; HI, MY NAME IS NOAH
     </code>
 </dd> 
 <dd>
     <code>
         #&gt; ^D
     </code>
 </dd>
 <dd>
     <code>
         #&gt;
     </code>
 </dd><dd>
</dd><dd>
</dd></dl>

<h4> Information</h4>
<ul>
<li>
    stdin and stdout are FILE* constants than can be used with fgetc and fputc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure you know how to recognize end of file (<i> EOF </i>).
  </li>
  <li>
    Control-D causes the Unix terminal driver to signal the EOF 
condition to the process running in this terminal foreground, using this
 key combination (shown in the above example as ^D) will cause <i>fgetc</i> to return an <i>EOF</i> constant and in response your program should terminate itself "normally".
  </li>
<li> Refer to <a href="http://www.asciitable.com/">ASCII</a> table for more information on how to convert characters to lower-case or upper-case. </li>
</ul>

<h4> Mandatory requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>You must read and process the input <b>character by character</b>, there is no need to store the characters you read at all.</li>
  <li> Important - you cannot make any assumption about the line length. </li>
  <li> Check whether a character is an lowercase letter by using a single "if" statement with two conditions. How?</li>
  <li>You are <b>not</b> allowed to use any library function for the purpose of recognizing whether a character is a letter, and its case.</li>
</ul>


<!-- ---------------- T A S K   1 B 2020 -------------------- -->
<h3> Task 1b: Extending the encoder to support debug mode </h3>

<p>
As you develop a program, it is important to allow for easy debugging.
The debug mode which you introduce here explains this idea. Using this 
scheme, any program can be run in a debug mode that allows special 
debugging features for testing the program. As a minimum, implemented 
here, when in debug mode the program prints out important information to
 stderr. Printing out the command-line
parameters allows for easy detection of errors in retrieving them.
Henceforth, code you write in most labs will also require adding a debug
 mode, and it is a good idea to have this option in <b>all</b> programs you write, even if <b>not required</b> to do so!
</p>
 
<dl>
  <dt> NAME </dt> <dd> encoder - encodes the input text as hexadecimal values.</dd>
  <dt> SYNOPSIS </dt>
  <dd> encoder [OPTION]... </dd>
  <dt> DESCRIPTION </dt>
  <dd>
  encoder receives text characters from standard input and prints the 
corresponding uppercase charachters to the standard output.<br>
  The debug mode is activated via command-line argument (-D).<br>
  If the debug-mode is activated, print the command-line arguments to <b>stderr</b> and each character you recieve from the input (hexadecimal value) before and after the conversion.<br>
  <b>regardless</b> of the debug-mode, the encoder will convert characters into uppercase.<br>

  </dd>

  <dd>

    </dd><dt> EXAMPLES </dt>
  <dd>
    <code>
#&gt; encoder -D
<br>-D
<br>Hi, my name is Noah
<br>48	48
<br>69	49
<br>2C	2C
<br>20	20
<br>60	40
<br>79	59
<br>20	20
<br>6E	4E
<br>61	41
<br>6D	4D
<br>65	45
<br>20	20
<br>69	49
<br>73	53
<br>20	20
<br>4E	4E
<br>6F	4F
<br>61	41
<br>68	48
<br>
<br>HI, MY NAME IS NOAH
<br>^D
<br>#&gt;
</code> 
    <li>Note: the left colomn is the hexadecimal representation of the <b>input</b> characters whereas the right colomn is the hexadecimal representation of the <b>modified</b> characters (in this case switched from lower-case to upper-case)</li>

  </dd>
</dl>

<h4> Mandatory requirements</h4>
<ul>

<li>You are <b>not</b> allowed to use any library function for the purpose of recognizing whether a character is a letter and its case.</li>
  <li> 
    Read your program parameters in the manner of task0 (main.c), first 
set default values to the variables holding the program configuration 
and then scan through <i>argv</i> to update those values. Points will be reduced for failing to do so.
  </li>
</ul><!-- ---------------- T A S K   1 C -------------------- -->
<h3> Task 1c: Extending the encoder to support encryption </h3>

In this task, make sure you follow the output format precisely.
Programs which deviate from the instructions will not be accepted!

Please make your output is exactly as the examples bellow.
<dl>
  <dt> NAME </dt> <dd> encoder - encodes the input text using encryption key.</dd>
  <dt> SYNOPSIS </dt>
  <dd> encoder [OPTION]... </dd>
  <dt> DESCRIPTION </dt>
  <dd>
  encoder receives characters from standard input and prints the 
corresponding encrypted characters to the standard output. The 
encryption key is given as a command-line argument.<br>
  If <b>no</b> argument is supplied, the encoder converts characters into uppercase as before.<br>
  The encryption key is of the following structure: +e{key}. The 
argument {key} stands for a sequence of digits whose value will be <b>added</b> to each input characters in sequence,
  in a <b>cyclic</b> manner.<br>
  This means that each digit in sequence recieved by the encoder is 
added to the coresponding character in sequence in the key. When and if 
the end of the key is reached, 
  re-start reading encoding digits from the begining of the key.

  You should support both addition and substruction, +e{key} is for 
addition and -e{key} is for substruction.

  On this task, you need to ignore the char '\n' which means new line 
after you press ENTER.
