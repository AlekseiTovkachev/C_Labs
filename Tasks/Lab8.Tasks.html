<p> This lab <b>may</b> be done in pairs.
</p><p>
You must complete task 0 before attending the lab, and we also recommend doing tasks 1a, 1b, and 1c before the lab.


</p><h3 id="lab_goals">Lab Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li> Extracting useful information from files in ELF. 
</li><li> Fixing files using this information: reverse engineering. 
</li></ul>

In the following labs, you will learn to handle object and executable 
files. We will begin by learning just some of the basics of ELF, 
together with applications you can already use at this level - editing 
binary files and writing software patches.
Then, we will continue our study of ELF files, by beginning to parse the
 structures of ELF files, and to use them for various purposes. In 
particular, we will access the data in the section header table and in 
the symbol table.
<h3 id="methodology">Methodology</h3>

<ul>
<li>Learn how to use the <i>readelf</i> utility. By using <i>readelf</i> you can get, in a human readable format, all the ELF structural information. 
</li><li>Experience basic ELF manipulation.
</li></ul>

<h3 id="recommended_operating_procedure">Recommended Operating Procedure</h3>
<b>This advice is relevant for all tasks.</b> Note that while at some point you will no longer be using <i>hexedit</i> to process the file and <i>readelf</i>
 to get the information, nevertheless in some cases you may still want 
to use these tools for debugging purposes. In order to take advantage of
 these tools and make your tasks easier, you should: 
<ul>
<li> Support debugging messages: in particular the offsets of the 
various items, as you discover them from the headers. Also, whenever the
 user
is required to enter values, you should print the <b>parsed</b> values in their respective representation (e.g. string, decimal or hexadecimal).
</li><li> Use <i>hexedit</i> and <i>readelf</i> to compare the information you are looking for, especially if you run into unknown problems: <i>hexedit</i> is great if you know the exact location of the item you are looking for. 
</li><li> Note that while the object files you will be processing will be linked using <i>ld</i>,
 and will, in most cases, use direct system calls in order to make the 
ELF file simpler, there is no reason why the programs you write need use
 this interface. You are allowed to use the standard library when 
building your own C programs. 
</li><li> In order to preserve your sanity, even if the code you 
MANIPULATE may be without stdlib, we advise that for your OWN CODE you 
DO use the C standard library! (Yes, this is repeated twice, so that you
 notice it!) 
</li><li> In order to keep sane in the following labs as well, <b>understand</b> what you are doing and <b>keep track</b> of that and of your code, as you will be using them in future labs. 
</li></ul>
<br>
<div class="warning">
All the executable files we will work with in this session are 32-Bit ELF binaries. <br>
Compile your code accordingly.

</p><h2 id="lab_8_tasks">Lab 8 Tasks</h2>

<h2 id="task_0">Task 0</h2>
<h3 id="task_0a">Task 0a:</h3>
Download the executable file <i>abc</i> (from the <a href="https://moodle.bgu.ac.il/moodle/mod/folder/view.php?id=2330341">Lab 8 auxilliary files</a>), and answer the following questions (be prepared to explain your answers to the lab instructor): 
<ol>
<li> Where is the entry point specified, and what is its value? 
</li><li> How many sections are there in "abc"? </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="task_0b">Task 0b</h3>
Write a program called <i>hexeditplus</i>:
<pre class="code"> ./hexeditplus
</pre>

<p></p><p>
The hexeditplus program performs operations (read and write) on files and memory. 
File operations are done on a file <i>file_name</i> as defined below. 
Each operation is done in units of <i>size</i> bytes, which indicates a 
unit size, i.e. the number of bytes we want to use as the basic unit in 
each operation of our program, such as "display memory contents". Size 
can be either 1, 2 or 4, with 1 as the default.
</p><p>
First, define a menu for the user with a number of predefined functions 
(as done inLab 2), to which we will add functions as we go. The program 
prints the menu, obtains a choice from the user, acts on it, and repeats
 infinitely.
For example, if the functions: "Toggle Debug Mode", "Set File Name", 
"Set Unit Size" and "Quit" are available, then the command line:
</p><pre class="code"> ./hexeditplus
</pre>

Will print:

<pre class="code">Choose action:
0-Toggle Debug Mode
1-Set File Name
2-Set Unit Size
3-Load Into Memory
4-Toggle Display Mode
5-Memory Display
6-Save Into File
7-Memory Modify
8-Quit 
</pre>


For this part, use an array with the above menu names and pointers to appropriate functions that implement each option,
using the same menu scheme from lab 2.
<p></p><p>
At this point implement "Toggle Debug Mode", "Set File Name", "Set Unit Size", and "Quit".
All other functions should at this point be stubs that print "Not implemented yet" and return
without doing anything else.
</p><p>
Toggle debug mode means turn the debug flag on (if it is currently off, which it is in the initial state), 
and print "Debug flag now on". If the debug flag is on, this function prints "Debug flag now off", and turns the flag off.
When the debug mode is on, you should print the value of the variables: unit_size, file_name, and mem_count,
every time just before the menu is printed. 
</p><p>
All functions should be of the form:
</p><pre class="code"> void fun(state* s); // Getting the state as a pointer allows the functions to change it.
</pre>

<p></p><p>
where the state struct is defined as:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="code">typedef struct {
  char debug_mode;
  char file_name[128];
  int unit_size;
  unsigned char mem_buf[10000];
  size_t mem_count;
  /*
   .
   .
   Any additional fields you deem necessary
  */
} state;
</pre>

<p></p><p>
<b>Set File Name</b> queries the user for a file name, and store it in <i>file_name</i>.
You may assume that the file name is no longer than 100 characters. If debug mode is on, the function should
also print: "Debug: file name set to 'file_name' " (obviously, replacing 'file_name' with the actual name).
</p><p>
<b>Set Unit Size</b> option sets the size variable. 
The steps are:
</p><ol>
<li> Prompt the user for a number.
</li><li> If the value is valid (1, 2, or 4), set the size variable accordingly.
</li><li> If debug mode is on, print "Debug: set size to x", with x the appropriate size.
</li><li> If not valid, print an error message and leave size unchanged.
</li></ol>
<br>
<b>Quit</b> is a function that prints "quitting" (in debug mode), and calls <code class="code">exit(0)</code> to quit the program. 
<p></p><p>
The rest of the functions will be written in the next tasks. The menu 
should be extensible, you will change and extend it in each sub-task of 
task 1.
It should be printed using a loop iterating over the menu array, and be 
{NULL, NULL} terminated.
</p><p>
Be sure to implement this code and test it carefully before the lab (that is why you have the debug option),
 as you will need to extend it during the lab!
 
 
</p><h2 id="task_1_hexeditplus">Task 1: hexeditplus</h2>
In this task we will write our own version of <i>hexedit</i> for working with binary files. You will extend your code from task 0b.<br>
Note: You should verify that there is no error when opening a file. In 
case of an error, you should print a message and abort the rest of the 
operation.<br>
For this task you will be working with the following ELF file: <i>abc</i> (see <a href="https://moodle.bgu.ac.il/moodle/mod/folder/view.php?id=2330341">Lab 8 auxilliary files</a>).<br>
<p></p><p>
<b>Note:</b> For any functions that handle files, the file needs to be opend and closed <b>within that function</b>
</p><h3 id="task_1a_load_into_memory">Task 1a: Load Into Memory</h3>
<b>For this task, you may assume that the size of the file is less than 10k bytes.</b>
<p></p><p>
Write the function for the "Load Into Memory" option, which works as follows:
</p><ul>
<li> Check if <i>file_name</i> is empty (i.e. equals to ""), and if it is print an error message and return.
</li><li> Open <i>file_name</i> for reading. If this fails, print an error message and return.
</li><li> Prompt the user for <i>location</i> (in hexadecimal) and <i>length</i> (in decimal).
</li><li> If debug flag is on, print the file_name, as well as <i>location</i>, and <i>length</i>.
</li><li> Copy <i>length</i> * <i>unit_size</i> <b>bytes</b> from <i>file_name</i> starting at position <i>location</i> into <i>mem_buf</i>. 
</li><li> Close the file.
</li></ul><br>

Assume that the user has already set the file name to "abc".
If the user chooses 3 on the menu, he is prompted for <i>location</i> and <i>length</i>.
It should look as follows:
<pre class="code">3
Please enter &lt;location&gt; &lt;length&gt;
12F 10
</pre>

The program should open the file abc and load the 10 bytes (assuming 
unit size is set to 1), from byte 303 to byte 312 in the file into <i>mem_buf</i>.
The output should look like:
<pre class="code">Loaded 10 units into memory
</pre>

<br>
<div class="tip"><b>Remember</b><br>
<ul>
<li> To read <i>location</i> and <i>length</i> use <tt>fgets</tt> and then <tt>sscanf</tt>, rather than <tt>scanf</tt> directly.
</li><li> <i>location</i> is entered in hexadecimal representation.
</li></ul>
</div>
<br>
<br>

<h3 id="task_1b_toggle_display_mode">Task 1b: Toggle Display Mode</h3>
Write the function for the "Toggle Display Mode" option, which swiches 
between display using a decimal representation, and by using a 
hexadecimal representation.
<p></p><p>
Toggle display mode means turn the display flag on and print using a 
hexadecimal representation, the initial state is off and print using a 
decimal representation. 
Print "Display flag now on, hexadecimal representation", and if the 
display flag is on, this function prints "Display flag now off, decimal 
representation", and turns the flag off.


For exmple, (assume that the display flag is off) entererint option 4 in
 the menu:
</p><pre class="code">4
Display flag now on, hexadecimal representation
4
Display flag now off, decimal representation
</pre>

<h3 id="task_1c_memory_display">Task 1c: Memory Display</h3>
Write the function for the "Memory Display" option: <br>
This option displays <i>u</i> units of size <i>unit_size</i> starting at address <i>addr</i> in memory.
Unit_size is already defined in <i>state</i>, but <i>u</i> and <i>addr</i> should be queried from
the user by this function. <i>u</i> will be given in decimal and <i>addr</i> in hexadecimal.
Entering a value of 0 for <i>addr</i> is a special case, in which the memory to be displayed starts at your mem_buf.
<p></p><p>
The units should be displayed according to the display flag. If the 
display flag is on then print using a hexadecimal representation, and if
 the display flag is off print using a decimal representation.<br>
</p><p>


If the user set the unit size to 2 and loaded a file into memory, then 
the output should look something like this (remember, we previously 
loaded 5 pairs of bytes from the file <i>abc</i>, located 303-312):
</p><pre class="code">Choose action:

</pre>

<br>
<ul>
<li>Note that, depending on the chosen unit size, the printed 
hexadecimal values may differ in order when compared with the output of <i>hexedit</i>.
Why is that?
</li></ul>
<br>
<p></p><p>
Use your newly implemented functionality to answer: what is the entry point of your own <i>hexeditplus</i> program? 
Verify your answer using <code class="code">readelf -h</code>
</p><p>
<br>
</p><div class="tip"><b>Working with units</b><br>
You are required to write code that handles data in unit sizes (i.e. not
 necessarily single bytes). This might confuse you into writing much 
more code than needed.
See on how to handle multiple unit sizes when reading, printing and 
writing without writing too much code. Relevant to this task is the 
function <code class="code">print_units</code>
</div>
<h3 id="task_1d_save_into_file">Task 1d: Save Into File</h3>
Write the function for the "Save Into File" option, which works as follows:<br>
This option replaces <i>length</i> units at <i>target-location</i> of <i>file_name</i> with bytes from the <b>hexeditplus</b> memory  starting at virtual address <i>source-address</i>.<br> <br>

When the user chooses option 6, the program should query the user for:
<ul>
<li> <i>source-address</i> (source memory address, in hexadecimal), <i>source-address</i> can be set to <code class="code">0</code>, in which case, the source address is start of <i>mem_buf</i>, on any other case, take an address in memory.
</li><li> <i>target-location</i> (target file offset, in hexadecimal),
</li><li> <i>length</i> (number of units, in decimal).
</li></ul>
<br>
Implement the checks that the file can be opened (for writing and NOT truncating), and print appropriate debug
messages in debug mode as in the previous task. Close the file after writing.
<p></p><p>
For example, after the file name was set to "abc" and unit size to 1 bytes, choosing option "5-Save Into File" using <i>source-address</i> 960c170, <i>target-location</i> 33 and <i>length</i> 4,
the program should write <i>length</i> = 4 bytes from memory, starting at address 0x960c170
to the file <i>abc</i>, starting from offset 0x33 (overwriting what was originally there).
It should look as follows:
</p><pre class="code">6
Please enter &lt;source-address&gt; &lt;target-location&gt; &lt;length&gt;
960c170 33 4
</pre>

Note that the target file is the one specified using option 1 in the menu.<br> <br>
Also observe that after you execute this option, <b>only</b> <i>length</i> units of the file <i>file_name</i> should be changed. 
<p></p><p>
</p><div class="info">
If <code class="code">&lt;target-location&gt;</code> is greater than the size of <code class="code">&lt;file_name&gt;</code> you should print an error message and not copy anything.
</div>
<p></p><p>
You should use <i>hexedit</i>, to verify that your code for tasks 1c and 1d works correctly,
by loading a portion of a file into memory and saving it to another file.<br>
Here is some of <i>hexedit</i>'s output for the file abc, verify that you understand why the output is as it is.

</p><h3 id="task_1e_memory_modify">Task 1e: Memory Modify</h3>
Write the function for the "Memory Modify" option: <br>
This option replaces a unit at <i>location</i> in memory buffer with <i>val</i>. <br>
The steps are:
<ol>
<li> Prompt the user for <i>location</i> and <i>val</i> (all in hexadecimal).
</li><li> If debug mode is on, print the location and val given by the user.
</li><li> Replace a unit at <i>location</i> in the memory with the value given by <i>val</i>.
</li></ol>
<br>

<br>
When the user chooses option 7, the program should query the user for:
<ul>
<li> <i>location</i> (memory buffer location, in hexadecimal)
</li><li> <i>val</i> (new value, in hexadecimal)
</li></ul>
<br>
For example, if unit size was set to 4, choosing option "7-Memory Modify" using <i>location</i> 0x40, <i>val</i> 0x804808a,
will overwrite the 4 bytes starting at location 0x40, with the new value 804808a.
It should look as follows:
<pre class="code">7
Please enter &lt;location&gt; &lt;val&gt;
40 804808a
</pre>

<p></p><p>
</p><div class="info">
As in the previous task, you should check that the location chosen to be
 modified, given the currentunit size, is valid, and act accordingly.
</div>
<p></p><p>
You can test the correctness of your code using hexedit.


</p><h2 id="task_2_reading_elf">Task 2: Reading ELF</h2>
Download the following file: deep_thought from Lab 08 Files.
<br> <br>
<code class="code">deep_thought</code> is an executable ELF file. It does not run as expected. Your task is to understand the reason for that.
<br> <br>
Do the following:
<p></p><p>
</p><ol>
    <li> Run the file.
    </li><li> Which function precedes main in execution ? (Hint: see assembly code in Lab 4).
    </li><li> What is the virtual address to which this function is loaded (Hint: use <code class="code">readelf -s</code>)
</li></ol>

<h3 id="task_2b">Fixing the buggy executable file</h3>

Use your <i>hexeditplus</i> program from task 1 to display the entry point of a file.
<p></p><p>
What are the values of <i>location</i>/<i>length</i>? How do you know that?
<br> <br>
Use the edit functions from <i>hexeditplu</i>s program to fix the <i>deep_thought</i> file, so that it behaves as expected.


</p><h2 id="task_3_delving_deeper_into_the_elf_structure">Task 3: Delving Deeper into the ELF Structure</h2>

The goal of this task is to display the compiled code (in bytes) of the function <tt>main</tt>, in 
the <i>offensive</i> executable in the lab 8 auxiliary files.
<p></p><p>
In order to do that, you need to:
 </p><ol>
 <li> find the offset (file location) of the function <tt>main</tt>.
 </li><li> find the size of the function <tt>main</tt>.
 </li><li> use your <i>hexeditplus</i> program to display the content of that function on the screen.
</li></ol>
<br>

<p>
Finding the needed information:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li> Find the entry for the function <tt>main</tt> in the symbol table of the ELF executable (<code class="code">readelf -s</code>).
</li><li> In that reference you will find both the size of the function and the function's virtual address and section number.
</li><li> In the section table of the executable, find the entry for the function's section (<code class="code">readelf -S</code>).
</li><li> Find both the section's virtual address (Addr), and the section's file offset (Off).
</li><li> Use the above information to find the file offset of the function.
</li></ol>

<h3>Hacking the executable file</h3>

Hack this executable file so that it does nothing when it is run:
replace the code of the <code class="code">main</code> function by  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP_(code)" class="external" rel="nofollow">NOP</a> instructions.<br>
Make sure you do NOT override the <code class="code">ret</code> instruction (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opcode" class="external" rel="nofollow">Opcode</a>: c3) in <code class="code">main</code>.<br>
Alternately, you can plant just one <code class="code">ret</code> instruction (where?).

<h2 id="task_4_hacking_installing_a_patch_using_hexeditplus">Task 4: Hacking: installing a patch using hexeditplus</h2>
The following file ntsc file  was meant to be a digit counter. Download it from Lab 08 Files, and run it in the command-line.<br>
<pre class="code"> ./ntsc aabbaba123baacca
 ./ntsc 1112111
</pre>

<p></p><p>
What is the problem with the file? (hint, try this string: 0123456789)
<br> <br>
Create a new program with a correct digit counter function (should get a
 char* and return an int), compile and test it. (remember to compile 
with the -m32 flag in order to produce an ELF compatible with 32bits). <b>You must compile with the flag `-fno-pie`</b> <br> 
<br>
Use <i>hexeditplus</i> to replace (patch) the buggy <tt>digit_cnt</tt> function in the <i>ntsc</i> file with the corrected version from the new program.<br> 
You should do it using options 3 &amp; 6 in <i>hexeditplus</i>. <br>
(think: are there any kinds of restrictions on the code you wrote for the <tt>digit_cnt</tt> function?)
<br>
Explain how you did it, and show that it works.
</p><p>

</p><h3 id="deliverables"> Deliverables:</h3> 
Tasks 1,2, and 3 must be completed during the regular lab. Task 4 may be done in a completion lab,
but only if you run out of time during the regular lab. The deliverables must be submitted until the end of the lab session.<br>
You must submit source files for task 1 and task 4 and a makefile that 
compiles them. The source files must be named task1.c, task4.c, and 
makefile.<br>
<h4> Submission instructions</h4>
